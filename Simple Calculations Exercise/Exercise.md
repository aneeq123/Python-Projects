A dog food company sells bags of dog food to customers at a cost of €6.75 per bag.
The company has decided to give discounts to volume buyers, with the rate of
discount being calculated by the number of bags purchased. The rate of discount to
be applied is as follows;
• 0% discount for less than 20 bags,
• 6% discount for 20 to 79 bags;
• 12% discount for 80 to 109 bags and
• 20% discount for 110 or more bags.

Write a Python program which asks the user for the number of bags purchased and
determine the rate of discount to be applied. The program should calculate the
amount due; the rate of discount to be applied and the final amount to be paid by the
customer. These three items should then be outputted to the screen. Your program
should also request a password from the user to allow access – they should only be
able to but dog food if the correct password is entered. Use the password
“QWERTY”.
